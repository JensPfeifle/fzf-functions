# FZF functions

Several fzf functions as described in my blog post [Improving shell workflows with fzf](https://seb.jambor.dev/posts/improving-shell-workflows-with-fzf/). Every function is available as a bash version and as a fish version. Activate them using `source <function-name>.bash` or `source <function-name>.fish`.
